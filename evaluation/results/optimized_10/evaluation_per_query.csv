============================================================

The following assertions violate FIBO ontology constraints:

1. TheLoan (Loan) rdf:type SecuredLoan (Class)
2. TheLoan (Loan) rdf:type UnsecuredLoan (Class)
3. TheLoan (Loan) rdf:type CommercialLoan (Class)
4. TheLoan (Loan) rdf:type ClosedEndCredit (Class)
5. TheLoan (Loan) hasLender Commerce Bank of America (FinancialInstitution)
6. TheLoan (Loan) hasBorrower ACME Industries LLC (Corporation)
7. TheLoan (Loan) hasLoanAmount USD 1,296,000.00 (Literal)
8. TheLoan (Loan) hasInterestRate 5.4% (Literal)
9. TheLoan (Loan) hasMaturityDate November 11, 2032 (Literal)

Possible violations:
• Disjointness: Entity cannot belong to disjoint classes
• Cardinality: Property exceeds allowed number of values
• Irreflexivity: Entity cannot have relation to itself
• Domain/Range: Property applied to incompatible entity types
